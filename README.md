# Fake-News-Prediction

I have referred the following Youtube video for this project: https://youtu.be/nacLBdyG6jE?si=SADEReszSwpNuWzZ
The link for the dataset is : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-news/data

This project uses a textual dataset of over 20000 news articles. Every news article has id, title, author, news and the label. The label 1 suggests that news is fake and 0 suggests real news. 
A logistic regression model has been used for prediction. 

The textual news is converted into numerical data using Tfidfvectorizer. 

The training accuracy was found to be almost 99% and test accuracy was found to be close to 98%.
